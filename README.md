# Hacky New Year ☃️

This is a small website I made for fun & for the [2024 Winter Boba Challenge](https://boba.hackclub.com/)! It's written in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. I made this website to take a break from high-level web frameworks and have some fun with custom particle effects made from just CSS and JavaScript. All the snow code is available in `snow.js`!

The website is running at [winter.gus.ink](https://winter.gus.ink). See if you can find the easter egg!

It's also fully mobile responsive, because why not.
